### **a. “The program execution in a computer involves performing instruction cycles, which includes two types of activities.” What are those? Explain.**

The instruction cycle in a computer involves two main activities:

1. **Fetch Cycle**:
   - The CPU fetches the next instruction from memory. The **Program Counter (PC)** holds the address of the next instruction to be executed. The instruction is fetched from memory and stored in the **Instruction Register (IR)**. The PC is then incremented to point to the next instruction.

2. **Execute Cycle**:
   - The CPU decodes the fetched instruction and performs the required operation. This may involve:
     - Reading data from memory (if the instruction requires data).
     - Performing arithmetic or logic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, AND, OR).
     - Writing data back to memory (if the instruction modifies data).
   - The execution cycle completes the operation specified by the instruction.

These two activities (fetch and execute) are repeated for every instruction in a program.

### **b. What are the two basic strategies used to improve the performance of a computer?**

The two basic strategies to improve computer performance are:

1. **Improving the performance of a single processor**:
   - This involves enhancing the speed and efficiency of a single CPU. Techniques include:
     - **Increasing clock speed**: Faster clock cycles allow more instructions to be executed per second.
     - **Using faster memory**: Reducing memory access latency improves overall performance.
     - **Pipelining**: Breaking instruction execution into stages to overlap fetch, decode, and execute operations.
     - **Superscalar execution**: Executing multiple instructions simultaneously using multiple functional units.
     - **Out-of-order execution**: Reordering instructions to maximize CPU utilization.

2. **Parallel Processing**:
   - This involves using multiple processors or cores to execute tasks simultaneously. Techniques include:
     - **Multiprocessing**: Using multiple CPUs in a single system.
     - **Multicore architectures**: Integrating multiple cores on a single chip.
     - **Distributed computing**: Using multiple computers connected via a network to solve large problems.

### **c. What are the significant differences between instruction-level parallelism and processor-level parallelism?**

- **Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP)**:
  - ILP refers to the execution of multiple instructions simultaneously within a single processor. It is achieved through techniques like:
    - **Pipelining**: Breaking instruction execution into stages to overlap operations.
    - **Superscalar execution**: Using multiple functional units to execute multiple instructions in parallel.
    - **Out-of-order execution**: Reordering instructions to maximize CPU utilization.
  - ILP focuses on optimizing the execution of instructions within a single processor.

- **Processor-Level Parallelism**:
  - This involves using multiple processors or cores to execute tasks in parallel. It includes:
    - **Multiprocessing**: Using multiple CPUs in a single system.
    - **Multicore architectures**: Integrating multiple cores on a single chip.

```

- **How MFU Helps**:
  - By having multiple functional units, a superscalar processor can execute multiple instructions in parallel, as long as there are no dependencies between them. This increases the number of instructions completed per clock cycle, improving performance.

### **h. “Time taken to complete m instructions in an n-stage pipeline is approximately n.” Establish.**

- In a pipelined processor, the time to complete **m instructions** in an **n-stage pipeline** is given by:
  \[
  \text{Total Time} = n + (m - 1) \text{ clock cycles}
  \]
- For large **m**, the term **(m - 1)** dominates, so the time is approximately **m clock cycles**.
- However, the question states that the time is approximately **n**, which is incorrect. The correct approximation is **m**.

### **i. A program takes 200 ns for execution on a non-pipelined processor. If we need to run 100 programs of the same type on four four-stage pipelined processors with a clock period of 5 ns, what is the speed-up ratio of the pipeline? What is the maximum achievable speed-up?**

- **Non-pipelined Execution Time**:
  \[
  \text{Time per program} = 200 \, \text{ns}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total time for 100 programs} = 100 \times 200 \, \text{ns} = 20,000 \, \text{ns}
  \]

- **Pipelined Execution Time**:
  \[
  \text{Clock period} = 5 \, \text{ns}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Time for one program} = n + (m - 1) \times \text{clock period} = 4 + (100 - 1) \times 5 \, \text{ns} = 4 + 495 = 499 \, \text{ns}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total time for 100 programs} = 499 \, \text{ns}
  \]

- **Speed-up Ratio**:
  \[
  \text{Speed-up} = \frac{\text{Non-pipelined time}}{\text{Pipelined time}} = \frac{20,000}{499} \approx 40.08
  \]

- **Maximum Achievable Speed-up**:
  \[
  \text{Maximum speed-up} = \text{Number of stages} = 4
  \]

  - A data hazard occurs when an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction that has not yet completed. This can cause incorrect results or stalls in the pipeline.

- **Software Solution**:
  - **Instruction Reordering**: The compiler can reorder instructions to minimize dependencies and avoid hazards.
  - **Inserting NOPs (No Operations)**: The compiler can insert NOPs to create delays and allow dependent instructions to complete.

### **k. What are the differences between scalar and vector registers? How is chaining used in vector processing?**

- **Scalar Registers**:
  - Store a single value (e.g., an integer or floating-point number).
  - Used for scalar operations (one operation at a time).

- **Vector Registers**:
  - Store multiple values (e.g., an array of integers or floating-point numbers).
  - Used for vector operations (multiple operations in parallel).

- **Chaining in Vector Processing**:
  - Chaining allows the output of one vector operation to be directly fed into another vector operation without storing intermediate results in memory. This reduces latency and improves performance.

3. **Power Consumption**:
   - CISC processors consume more power due to their complexity.

4. **Limited Pipelining**:
   - The complexity of CISC instructions makes it difficult to implement efficient pipelining.

---

### **m. How does main memory interleaving increase the performance of a computer?**

- **Memory Interleaving**:
  - Memory interleaving divides memory into multiple banks that can be accessed simultaneously. This allows multiple memory accesses to occur in parallel, reducing latency and increasing throughput.

- **Performance Improvement**:
  - By overlapping memory accesses, interleaving reduces the time the CPU spends waiting for data, improving overall performance.

---

### **n. What kinds of interrupts are the following?**

1. **Data Transfer → I/O Interrupt**:
   - Generated when data transfer between I/O devices and memory is complete.

2. **INT Instruction → Software Interrupt**:
   - Generated by software to request services from the operating system.

3. **Error in CPU Hardware → Hardware Interrupt**:
   - Generated when a hardware error occurs (e.g., power failure, memory error).

4. **Overflow → Arithmetic Interrupt**:
   - Generated when an arithmetic operation results in an overflow.

5. **Illegal Opcode → Exception**:
   - Generated when the CPU encounters an invalid instruction.

6. **End of I/O → I/O Interrupt**:
   - Generated when an I/O operation completes.

| **Memory Access**         | Supports direct memory-to-memory operations (e.g., ADD [A], [B]).                                          | Uses load/store architecture (only LOAD and STORE instructions access memory).                              |
| **Registers**             | Fewer general-purpose registers (more reliance on memory).                                                | More general-purpose registers (reduces memory access).                                                    |
| **Pipelining**            | Difficult to implement pipelining due to variable instruction lengths and complex instructions.            | Easier to implement pipelining due to fixed instruction lengths and simple instructions.                    |
| **Compiler Complexity**   | Compiler design is simpler because complex instructions reduce the number of instructions in a program.    | Compiler design is more complex because it must optimize instruction sequences for performance.             |
