Hereâ€™s a **chart** summarizing the differences between **Multitasking** and **Multiprocessing**:

| **Aspect**                | **Multitasking**                                                                                     | **Multiprocessing**                                                                                     |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**            | Executing multiple tasks or processes concurrently on a **single CPU** by rapidly switching between them. | Executing multiple tasks or processes simultaneously using **multiple CPUs or cores**.                  |
| **Hardware Requirement**  | Requires only **one CPU**.                                                                          | Requires **multiple CPUs or cores**.                                                                    |
| **Concurrency**           | Achieves concurrency by **time-sharing** the CPU among multiple tasks.                              | Achieves concurrency by **parallel execution** of tasks on multiple CPUs or cores.                      |
| **Performance**           | Limited by the speed of a single CPU.                                                               | Higher performance due to parallel execution on multiple CPUs or cores.                                 |
| **Resource Utilization**  | Efficiently utilizes a single CPU by overlapping I/O and computation tasks.                         | Efficiently utilizes multiple CPUs or cores for computationally intensive tasks.                        |
| **Complexity**            | Less complex to implement as it relies on a single CPU.                                             | More complex to implement due to the need for coordination between multiple CPUs or cores.               |
| **Examples**              | - Running a web browser and a text editor simultaneously on a single-core CPU.                      | - Running multiple applications on a multi-core CPU (e.g., gaming while rendering a video).             |
| **Use Case**              | Suitable for systems with a single CPU or lightweight tasks.                                        | Suitable for systems with multiple CPUs or cores and computationally intensive tasks.                   |

### **Key Takeaways**:
- **Multitasking** is about sharing a single CPU among multiple tasks by rapidly switching between them.
- **Multiprocessing** is about using multiple CPUs or cores to execute tasks in parallel, providing higher performance for demanding workloads.
